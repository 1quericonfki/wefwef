### Using the Serial Number
  
The serial number of your Siemens VDO NCDR 1100 radio is a 14-digit alphanumeric code that starts with GM or RN and is located on a sticker on the side or top of the radio. You will need to remove the radio from the dashboard to access it. To do this, you will need a set of radio removal keys that fit into the slots on the front of the radio. You can buy these keys online or from a local car parts store. Once you have the keys, insert them into the slots and pull the radio out gently.

### Using an OBDII Tool
  
An OBDII tool is a device that can communicate with your car's computer and perform various diagnostic and programming functions. You can use an OBDII tool to deactivate the immobilizer of your Siemens VDO NCDR 1100 radio and unlock it without a code. However, you will need a specific OBDII tool that is compatible with your Opel car and your radio model, such as OPCOM or TECH2. These tools are usually expensive and not widely available, so you may need to visit an Opel dealer or a specialized garage to use them.
  
To use an OBDII tool, you will need to connect it to your car's OBD port, which is usually located under the dashboard near the steering wheel. You will then need to follow the instructions on the tool's screen to access the radio menu and select the option to deactivate the immobilizer. You may also need to enter some information about your car, such as the VIN number or the chassis number. Once the immobilizer is deactivated, your radio should work normally without asking for a code.
  
## How to Enter Your Siemens VDO NCDR 1100 Radio Code
  
If you have your Siemens VDO NCDR 1100 radio code, you can enter it easily by following these steps:
  
1. Turn on your radio and wait for it to display "CODE" or "SAFE".
2. Press and hold the AS button until you hear a beep and see "10 - - - -" on the display.
3. Use the preset buttons 1 to 4 to enter each digit of your code. For example, if your code is 1234, press button 1 once, button 2 twice, button 3 three times, and button 4 four times.
4. Press and hold the AS button again until you hear a beep and see "CODE" on the display.
5. Your radio should be unlocked and ready to use.

If you enter an incorrect code, you will see "SAFE" on the display and have to wait for 10 seconds before trying again. If you enter an incorrect code three times in a row, you will see "SAFE" flashing and have to wait for one hour before trying again. If this happens, do not turn off your radio or disconnect your battery, as this will
