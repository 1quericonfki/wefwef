To configure CData FireDAC Components for Google Calendars 17.0.6521, you need to provide some connection properties that specify how to authenticate and access your Google Calendar data. The most important properties are:

- **OAuthClientId**: The client ID assigned by Google when you register your application.
- **OAuthClientSecret**: The client secret assigned by Google when you register your application.
- **CallbackURL**: The URL that Google will redirect to after the user grants or denies permission.
- **InitiateOAuth**: Set this property to GETANDREFRESH or REFRESH in order to initiate the OAuth flow.

You can find more information about how to obtain these values and how to register your application with Google in the [CData documentation](https://www.cdata.com/kb/tech/googlecal-fd-connection.rst).
  
## How to Connect to Google Calendar Data Using the TFDConnection Component
  
The TFDConnection component is used to establish a connection to Google Calendar data using the FireDAC framework. To use this component, you need to drag it from the Tool Palette onto your form or data module, and then set its ConnectionDefName property to CData.GoogleCalendar.
  
Next, you need to set the connection properties as described in the previous section. You can do this either in code or in design time using the Connection Editor dialog. For example, in code, you can write:
  `
FDConnection1.Params.Values['OAuthClientId'] := 'your_client_id';
FDConnection1.Params.Values['OAuthClientSecret'] := 'your_client_secret';
FDConnection1.Params.Values['CallbackURL'] := 'http://localhost:33333';
FDConnection1.Params.Values['InitiateOAuth'] := 'GETANDREFRESH';
`  
Alternatively, in design time, you can double-click on the TFDConnection component and use the Connection Editor dialog to enter the values for each property.
  
Once you have set the connection properties, you can open the connection by calling the Open method of the TFD
